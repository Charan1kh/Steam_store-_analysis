# Steam_store-_analysis

In this GitHub repository I present a comprehensive analysis of Valve's Steam game store using state-of-the-art data visualization tools and techniques. Leveraging the power of Tableau, MS Excel, and MySQL, I have meticulously cleaned and processed a large dataset containing information about over 27,000 games scraped from Steam and SteamSpy APIs, which is available on Kaggle, added by NIK DAVIS (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games).

The resulting visualization is presented in the form of an interactive dashboard that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs), top games, category analysis, free versus paid games, top publishers, and top developers by volume. Each of these visualizations provides valuable insights into the behavior of Steam users and game developers, thereby shedding light on important industry trends and patterns.

As a passionate data enthusiast, I have taken great care to ensure that the data is accurate, while also ensuring that it is presented in a manner that is both engaging and accessible. And I am excited to share it with the broader community of data professionals and enthusiasts:)
